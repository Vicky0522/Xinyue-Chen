## About me

Hi! I am Xinyue Chen, a Senior student at New York University Shanghai. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/) of NYU. And I am working as a research intern in Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/)'s group in UCSD starting from Summer 2021.
My current research focuses on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and its applications. I am also broadly interested in topics like Computer Vision and Robotics. 

I am looking for grad school oppurtunities in Fall 2022 :)
