## About me

Hi! I am Xinyue Chen, a Junior student at New York University Shanghai. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/).
My current research focuses on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and its applications. I am also broadly interested in topics like Computer Vision and Robotics.

## News
* I will be working as a Summer intern in [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/)'s group in UCSD.
* A paper accepted to Top-tier Machine Learning conference ICLR 2021
* A paper accepted to Top-tier Machine Learning conference NeurIPS 2020.
